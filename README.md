# glassdoor_scraper
 
## Project overview
I adjusted a scraper for glassdoor.com to the german glassdoor page and gathered data of around 1000 data science job offers to support my job search. I wanted to find out

1. which skills and keywords are the most requested
2. which industries offer the most jobs
3. in which locations are the most jobs offered

So I can improve these skills and find the most relevant job offers.

## Example of a result
