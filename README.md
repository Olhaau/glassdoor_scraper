# Scraper for glassdoor.de
 
## Project overview
I adjusted a scraper github repo (see below) for glassdoor.com to the german glassdoor page and gathered information of around 1000 data science job offers to support my job search. I wanted to find out

1. which skills and keywords are the most requested
2. which industries offer the most jobs
3. in which locations are the most jobs offered

to choose skills to improve and find the most relevant job offers.
